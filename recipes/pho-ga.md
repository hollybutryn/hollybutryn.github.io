# Pho Ga (Chicken Pho)

Prep Time: probably an hourish total
Cook Time: about 4 hours (hope you don’t mind hanging around your house for a few hours) Serves: Maybe 4 people (depends on how big you make your bowls)
Notes:​ This recipe was based off of a Pho Ga recipe that had some vague instructions, along with a few other tips and cooking instructions from different sources (Ina Garten’s Perfect Roast Chicken recipe, and Serious Eats How to Toast Spices instructional). It’s probably not the “correct” way to prepare Pho, but boiled chicken is terrible, so I roast mine for the superior flavor and texture it’ll produce. This version of chicken pho is going to produce a richer broth than traditional pho ga; but, you can boil your chicken to make your pho “correctly,”. And, if you enjoy the taste of rubbery, chewy, inedible chicken, I recommend googling “chicken pho recipes.”
Ingredients
1 Whole Chicken (5-6 lbs)
2 Yellow Onions, halved (reserve half an onion for garnish)
2 inches of Ginger, sliced in half longways
3 cloves of Garlic (leave in skins while roasting; remove skins for broth)
2 Leeks (trim and discard roots and dark green leaves; slice leek down the middle and rinse out dirt; set aside)
1 Tbsp Salt (you might not need the full amount)
1 inch chunk of Rock Sugar -or- 1/2 Tbsp White Sugar
2 Tbsp Chicken stock powder (optional)
5-6 Star Anise
2 Cinnamon Sticks
5-6 Whole Cloves
Bowl Assembly
Rice Noodles (cooked per package instructions; unless you get the flat half inch wide noodles (not recommended) those need to cook for at least 10 minutes or they're not edible).
Sliced Chicken
Garnish
Green Onions, chopped Cilantro
Onion, thinly sliced Bean Sprouts, rinse well Jalapenos, sliced
Lime wedges Hoisin Sauce Sriracha Sauce
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
2. Remove the chicken giblets. Rinse the chicken inside and out. Remove any excess fat and leftover pin feathers and pat the outside dry. Season the chicken with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
3. Place chicken along with onions, garlic cloves, and ginger slices in a roasting pan or dutch oven. (I'm lazy and like to roast my chicken in the dutch oven uncovered so I can just move it to the stovetop for the rest of the cooking process).
4. Roast the chicken 1 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and thigh. Remove chicken from pot and let rest 20 minutes before carving. In the meantime, add water (about 4-5 quarts [16-20 cups] for a 6 quart Dutch pot) and 1/2 Tbsp of salt to the pot (leave in the onions, garlic, and ginger) and bring to a boil.
5. Return chicken bones to the pot and add in the leeks; cover and simmer for an hour.
6. After an hour taste the broth, add salt if needed, (I recommend 1 tsp for now). Also add in your rock sugar or regular sugar and chicken stock powder (although this could be left out since we've technically made our own chicken stock by roasting the chicken first).
7. Cover and simmer another half hour, then taste and add more salt (another teaspoon if necessary).
8. Toast the cinnamon stick, star anise, and cloves in a small pan over medium heat. Shake it or stir the spices to prevent burning. Smaller spices and spices with thin skins need just a minute, larger ones take a few minutes longer. They are done when they start to smell fragrant and toasty. Remove from heat to prevent over toasting and add spices to the pot for 20 minutes.
9. Remove the bones, veggies and spices from the pot. Assemble the bowls: noodles, chicken (you can give them a dunk in the pot before adding to the bowl), broth.
10. Add your toppings, (Google some Vietnamese songs to listen to while eating...I mean if you want to make it feel authentic), and enjoy. I hope you like it!
